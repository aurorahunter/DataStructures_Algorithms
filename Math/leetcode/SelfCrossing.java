/*
You are given an array x of n positive numbers. You start at point (0,0) and moves x[0] metres to the north, then x[1] metres to the west, x[2] metres to the south, x[3] metres to the east and so on. In other words, after each move your direction changes counter-clockwise.

Write a one-pass algorithm with O(1) extra space to determine, if your path crosses itself, or not.

Example 1:
Given x = 
[2, 1, 1, 2]
,
┌───┐
│   │
└───┼──>
    │

Return true (self crossing)
Example 2:
Given x = 
[1, 2, 3, 4]
,
┌──────┐
│      │
│
│
└────────────>

Return false (not self crossing)
Example 3:
Given x = 
[1, 1, 1, 1]
,
┌───┐
│   │
└───┼>

Return true (self crossing)

Draw a line of length a. Then draw further lines of lengths b, c, etc. How does the a-line get crossed? From the left by the d-line or from the right by the f-line, see the above picture. I just encoded the criteria for actually crossing it.

Two details:

In both cases, d needs to be at least b. In the first case to cross the a-line directly, and in the second case to get behind it so that the f-line can cross it. So I factored out d >= b.
The "special case" of the e-line stabbing the a-line from below is covered because in that case, the f-line "crosses" it (note that even if there is no actual f-line, my code uses f = 0 and thus still finds that "crossing"). **/
